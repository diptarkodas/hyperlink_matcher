The script [hyperlink_matcher-share.py] matches new arXiv entries (title & abstract) against provided keywords ( in [keyword.dat] file present in same directory ) and prints out the ones with non-zero weights after sorting. You can modify the code to make it send an email with the consolidated selected list to yourself. Please feel free to share.

The script runs on Python. Make sure "requests" and "BeautifulSoup" are installed.
